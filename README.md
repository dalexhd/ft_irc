## [](#message-format)Message Format

An IRC message is a single line, delimited by a pair of `CR` `('\r', 0x0D)` and `LF` `('\n', 0x0A)` characters.

- When reading messages from a stream, read the incoming data into a buffer. Only parse and process a message once you encounter the `\r\n` at the end of it. If you encounter an empty message, silently ignore it.
- When sending messages, ensure that a pair of `\r\n` characters follows every single message your software sends out.

---

Messages have this format, as rough ABNF:

      message         ::= ['@' <tags> SPACE] [':' <source> SPACE] <command> <parameters> <crlf>
      SPACE           ::=  %x20 *( %x20 )   ; space character(s)
      crlf            ::=  %x0D %x0A        ; "carriage return" "linefeed"

The specific parts of an IRC message are:

- **tags**: Optional metadata on a message, starting with `('@', 0x40)`.
- **source**: Optional note of where the message came from, starting with `(':', 0x3A)`.
- **command**: The specific command this message represents.
- **parameters**: If it exists, data relevant to this specific command.

These message parts, and parameters themselves, are separated by one or more ASCII SPACE characters `(' ', 0x20)`.

Most IRC servers limit messages to 512 bytes in length, including the trailing `CR-LF` characters. Implementations which include [message tags](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/message-tags.html) need to allow additional bytes for the **tags** section of a message; clients must allow 8191 additional bytes and servers must allow 4096 additional bytes.
